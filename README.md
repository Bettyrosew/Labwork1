# Labwork1
Using HTML 5/HTML and CSS (you could use CSS and JavaScript libraries of framework), design a simple but good-looking interface for an app (do not implement the server logic), which could allow a user to:

To create an account (using full name, email, city of residence, and profile photo)
Login (to some empty page showing user full name, profile pic and logout button or link) (email and password)
And change password (using current and new password)
